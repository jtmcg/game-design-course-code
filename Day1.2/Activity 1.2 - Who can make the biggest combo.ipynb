    "Python is a very well supported language, and its open source. This means many other people have already made lots and lots of code to do many useful things. We can use their code with a simple command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import module`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import` function allows us to access the objects and methods within the module we're importing using the `.` command. Calling an object or method from an imported module looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`module.object`<br/>\n",
    "`module.method()`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also give a module a knickname when you import it. That looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import module as carl`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to call and object or method from the module, I use the nickname instead of the module name:\n",
    "\n",
    "`carl.object`<br/>\n",
    "`carl.method()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can input specific objects or functions from a module by using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from module import object, function`\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll learn about the differences between these later, but first, we will be using import to carry out today's activity. We will be importing a module I made for today's activity called `comboActivity` and creating a `combo_tester` instance of the ComboActivity object. The import statement is below:"
