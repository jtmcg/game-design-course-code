While we could start at the 0th fuse and test every fuse until we blew one, there is a faster, more efficient way to do it. Instead, starting with fuse 1, we will test every other fuse. Once we blow a fuse, we know that either that fuse, the Nth fuse, is the last one OR the (N-1)th fuse is the last fuse.
