This repo is the code base for my three week Game Design course that is intended as a simultaneous intro to programming and game design. It assumes no previous coding experience, and is tailored for around 4-6 hours of work each day.

Schedule:
Week 1: Intro to Python using the Jupyter Notebook
Week 2: Intro to Pygame using the Spyder IDE
Week 3: Final Project - Design and build your own game

The course uses the Anaconda python distribution package: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
